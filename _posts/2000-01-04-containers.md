##Docker Images for Malware Analysis Tools

An new initiative of the REMnux project involves building [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images of popular malware analysis tools. Stay tuned for more details. If you're new to Docker, you can learn how to [distribute and run apps inside containers](http://blog.zeltser.com/post/102956975282/docker-application-distribution). You can see the images built to date on the [REMnux Docker hub repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/remnux/).
