##Docker Images for Malware Analysis Tools

One aspect of the REMnux project involves providing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images of popular malware analysis tools, with the goal of allowing investigators to conveniently utilize difficult-to-install applications without having to install the REMnux distro. Such images could be compared to lightweight virtual machines; though they donâ€™t offer the same level of isolation as real VMs, they provide a container within which the application can be encapsulated along with its dependencies.

For more information about this initiative, see REMnux documentation related to [Docker Images for Malware Analysis](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/malware-analysis/). You can also see what application [images have been built to date and how to run them](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/run-apps/) and even [contribute your own Docker images](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/create-docker-images/) to the collection.
