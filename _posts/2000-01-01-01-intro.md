# REMnux: A free Linux Toolkit for Reverse-Engineering and Analyzing Malware

![REMnux Logo](img/REMnux-logo.png)

REMnux is a lightweight toolkit for assisting malware analysts with reverse-engineering malicious software. The heart of the project is the REMnux Linux distribution based on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). This distro incorporates many free tools for analyzing malicious software that runs on Windows and Linux, examining browser-based malware, such as Flash programs and obfuscated JavaScript, and taking apart other malicious artifacts.

In addition to examining malware within the REMnux environment, forensic investigators can also use the distro to intercept suspicious network traffic in an isolated lab environment when performing behavioral malware analysis. As part of this process, the investigator typically infects another laboratory system with the specimen and redirects the connections to the REMnux system listening on the appropriate ports.

You can learn the malware analysis techniques that make use of the tools installed and pre-configured on REMnux by taking the [Reverse-Engineering Malware](http://www.sans.org/course/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques) at SANS Institute.

REMnux aims to be lightweight, focusing on the most practical freely-available malware analysis tools that run on Linux. If you are looking for a more full-featured distribution that incorporates a broader range of digital forensic analysis utilities, take a look at [SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT) Workstation](http://computer-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads/).

REMnux has been [updated to version 5](http://blog.zeltser.com/post/86508269224/remnux-v5-release-for-malware-analysts) in May 2014. Version 1 of this distro came out in 2010. The next version of REMnux is in the works.
