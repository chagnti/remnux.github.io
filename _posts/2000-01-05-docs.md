#REMnux Documentation

To get started with the REMnux distro and become familiar with some of its tools, tune into the following recorded webcasts:

- [Malware Analysis Essentials Using REMnux](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/malware-analysis-essentials-remnux-w-lenny-zeltser-98045)
- [What's New in REMnux v4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LzCr9qf5_Q)

The one-page [REMnux cheat sheet](http://zeltser.com/remnux/remnux-malware-analysis-tips.html) provides a reasonable reference. Also, the [Xmind-formatted mind map](http://zeltser.com/remnux/remnux-v5-tools.xmind) of the tools that comprise the REMnux distro include brief references for each tool and a tip for how to launch it.

[REMnux documentation](http://REMnux.org/docs) is a relatively recent effort, which can provide  additional details regarding REMnux. The document set in need of improvement and expansion. If you'd like to contribute to this aspect of the project, please [let us know](http://zeltser.com/about/contact.html).
