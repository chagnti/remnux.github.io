REMnux Development
------------------

REMnux is maintained by [Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/) with extensive help from [David Westcott](https://twitter.com/beast_fighter). There are several ways in which you can also contribute to the project, as outlined below.

**Documentation**

Write documentation for tools installed on the REMnux distro to expand the tips and guidelines that already exist in the [How to Use REMnux Tools](https://remnux.org/docs/distro/tools/) section. Please format your document using the popular and easy-to-use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), then [send your docs to Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/contact/).

**Dockerfile Configurations**

Create Dockerfile configs for building Docker images of malware analysis applications that are not yet present in the [REMnux Docker image collection](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/run-apps/). If you are new to Docker, you can learn how to [distribute and run apps inside containers](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/malware-analysis/) and how to [build your own images](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/create-docker-images/). Once you have built and tested your Dockerfile, [share it with Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/contact/).

**Issues and Fixes**

If you come across problems with tools available as part of REMnux, specially if you have suggestions for correcting the issues, please log them on the REMnux [distro repository](https://github.com/REMnux/distro/issues) or [Dockerfile repository](https://github.com/REMnux/docker/issues) on Github.

**Many Thanks**

We are grateful to the developers of Linux, Ubuntu, GNU, and the freely-available malware reversing and analysis utilities that comprise REMnux for their contributions to the community. Also, thank you to the individuals who provided feedback, instructions and recommendations for improving the REMnux toolkit.
