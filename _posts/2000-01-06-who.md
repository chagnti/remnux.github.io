#REMnux Oversight

REMnux is maintained by [Lenny Zeltser](http://zeltser.com) with extensive help from [David Westcott](https://twitter.com/beast_fighter).

We are grateful to the developers of Linux, Ubuntu, GNU, and the freely-available malware reversing and analysis utilities that comprise REMnux for their contributions to the community. Also, thank you to the individuals who provided feedback, instructions and recommendations for improving the REMnux toolkit.
