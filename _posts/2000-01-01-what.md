#REMnux: A Linux Toolkit for Reverse-Engineering and Analyzing Malware

REMnux is a free toolkit for assisting malware analysts with reverse-engineering malicious software. It strives to make it easier for forensic investigators and incident responders to start using the variety of freely-available tools that can examine malware, yet might be difficult to locate or set up.

The heart of the project is the REMnux Linux distribution based on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). This lightweight distro incorporates many tools for analyzing Windows and Linux malware, examining browser-based threats such as obfuscated JavaScript, exploring suspicious document files and taking apart other malicious artifacts. Investigators can also use the distro to intercept suspicious network traffic in an isolated lab  when performing behavioral malware analysis.

You can learn the malware analysis techniques that make use of the tools installed and pre-configured on REMnux by taking [Reverse-Engineering Malware training](http://www.sans.org/course/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques) at SANS Institute. REMnux has been [updated to version 5](http://blog.zeltser.com/post/86508269224/remnux-v5-release-for-malware-analysts) in May 2014. Version 1 of this distro came out in 2010. The version 6 of the REMnux distro is in the works.
