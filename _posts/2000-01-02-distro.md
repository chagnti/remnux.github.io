## Download and Install the REMnux Distro

The simplest way to get the REMnux distro is to [download the REMnux virtual appliance file](http://sourceforge.net/projects/remnux/files/version6/remnux-6.0-ova-public.ova/download) in the OVA format, then import it into your favorite virtualization application. After starting the resulting virtual machine, run the "update-remnux full" command to update its software. For detailed instructions, please [see REMnux documentation](https://remnux.org/docs/distro/get/#download-the-remnux-virtual-appliance).

Alternatively, you can add the REMnux distro to an existing physical or virtual system running a compatible version of Ubuntu, including SIFT Workstation. You can accomplish this by running the REMnux installation script on the system, [as explained in the documentation](https://remnux.org/docs/distro/get/#install-remnux-on-an-existing-system).
