Prior to using the REMnux virtual appliance, you'll need to obtain virtualization software such as [VMware Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/), [VMware Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/), [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). If you encounter problems installing REMnux, please see the tips, issues, errata and workarounds outlined in REMnux Version 5 Installation Notes document.

### OVF/OVA Virtual Appliance for Most Virtualization Tools

To install the REMnux virtual appliance, first download [remnux-5.0-ovf-public.ova](http://sourceforge.net/projects/remnux/files/version5/remnux-5.0-ova-public.ova/download). This file Open Virtualization Format (OVF/OVA) and is compatible with many virtualization tools.

Open the downloaded file with your virtualization tool and import it to create the virtual machine out of it. For additional details, see instructions for [installing the REMnux virtual appliance in the OVF/OVA format](http://computer-forensics.sans.org/blog/2013/04/10/installing-remnux-virtual-appliance).

If using the OVF/OVA virtual appliance with VMware, you can optionally install VMware Tools in REMnux to automatically adjust the screen size.

### VMware Virtual Appliance with Preinstalled VMware Tools

If using VMware, you have the option of getting the virtual appliance using the proprietary VMware format. For this, download [remnux-5.0-vm-public.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/remnux/files/version5/remnux-5.0-vm-public.zip/download) instead of the .ova file. The advantage of this version of the appliance is that it includes pre-installed VMware Tools.

Extract the downloaded .zip file's contents into a dedicated folder and open the REMnuxV5.vmx file with VMware Player, Workstation or Fusion. If VMware asks you whether the virtual machine was moved or copied, select "I copied it."

If using VMware ESX, you can use [VMware vCenter Converter](http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/)  to convert the VMware virtual appliance to the ESX format. You can convert the VMware virtual appliance into the format compatible with [Hyper-V](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/solutions/virtualization.aspx). The free [StarWind V2V Converter](http://www.starwindsoftware.com/converter) offers a convenient way to accomplish this.

### Connecting REMnux to the Internet

The REMnux virtual appliance is configured to use the "host-only" network, isolating the REMnux instance from the physical network. To connect REMnux to the network, for instance, to provide it with Internet access, change the settings of the virtual appliance to the appropriate network, such as "NAT" then issue the "`renew-dhcp`" command in REMnux.
