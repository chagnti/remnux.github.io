## Download and Install the REMnux Distro

The simplest way to get the REMnux distro is to [download the REMnux virtual appliance file](https://googledrive.com/host/0B6fULLT_NpxMQ1Rrb1drdW42SkE/remnux-6.0-ova-public.ova) in the OVA format, then import it into your favorite virtualization application. After starting the resulting virtual machine, run the "update-remnux full" command to update its software. For detailed instructions, please [see REMnux documentation](https://remnux.org/docs/distro/get/#download-the-remnux-virtual-appliance).

The virtual appliance file is around 2GB in size; its SHA-256 hash is C26BE9831CA414F5A4D908D793E0B8934470B3887C48CFE82F86943236968AE6. Be sure to only download the OVA file from the link off this official REMnux website and validate that the file's hash matches the one above.

Alternatively, you can add the REMnux distro to an existing physical or virtual system running a compatible version of Ubuntu, including SIFT Workstation. You can accomplish this by running the REMnux installation script on the system, [as explained in the documentation](https://remnux.org/docs/distro/get/#install-remnux-on-an-existing-system).

You can also run the [REMnux virtual appliance in a public cloud](https://remnux.org/docs/distro/cloud/).
